Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy: fundamentals and advances in instrumentation, analysis, and applications:

Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) Overview
  - measures time a fluorophore remains in an excited state
      - photon timing histogram
      - phase-frequency plot
  - sensitive to disease progression, drug efficacy
  - quantifies chemical, physical changes (temp, viscosity, pH, etc)
  - Study cell metabolism, protein interactions, disease research

1.1 Flourescence Lifetime (why Lifetime?)
  - Molecule absorbs light, electron moves to higher level
  - Electron loses energy and moves to lowest excited state
  - Returns to ground state, releases light
  - Emitted < Absorbed Light -> Stokes Shift

1.2 Autofluorescence FLIM Measurements
  - NADH and FAD are fluorescent and thus can be used for imaging

1.3 FLIM-FRET Microscopy
  - Detailed view of molecular interactions
  - Donor and Acceptor Fluorophore

1.4 Advantages of FLIM Over Intensity Imaging
  - Can distinguish spectrally overlapping fluorophores (NAD(P)H)
  - Less affected by changes in fluorophore concentration
  - Does not require calibration steps like intensity-based measurements
  - Less affected by light scattering

2 Instrumentation
  - Time-domain FLIM
      - Short pulse of light for excitation
      - Records exponential decay directly or time-resolved electronics
  - Frequency-domain FLIM
      - Excitation is continous as a sine wave
      - Analyzes phase delay and amplitude modulation
      - Fast acquisition speed, performs well with bright samples
  - TCSPC
      - Measures the time between excitation and emission photons
      - High accuracy of lifetime estimation
  - Time-Gating (TG)
      - Samples decay at multiple time gates for faster acquisition
      - Lower electronic dead time than TCSPC

2.1 Microscopy
  - Laser Scanning Microscopy (LSM)
      - Opital sectioning, allowing 3D FLIM imaging
      - Offers out-of-focus rejection, leading to higher contrast
      - Paired with faster electronics
  - Wide-field Illumination (WFI)
      - Uses parallel illumintation field at focus of the objective lens
          - Collects fluorescence from the focal plane onto a camera
      - Higher frame rates than LSM
      - Lower camera sensitivity

  - Phasor Methods
      - Transforms decay into a 2D phasor space, 
      - Rapid analysis of FLIM data by clustering pixels with similar lifetimes
      - Phasor Analaysis

3.2 Fluorescence Lifetime Heterogeneity Analysis
  - Pixel-level Analysis
      - Captures subcellular and cell-level heterogeneity
  - Object-level Analysis
      - Lifetime distributions are analyzed using population density models
          - Identify subpopulations and quantify heterogeneity
